# Nitro-System-Fivem
A nitro system for fivem ,combined by other nitro scripts

The original script is the Advanced nitro system for FiveM by Deltanic.
What i ve done(so far):
1.New method of boosting
2.Cooldown between nitro uses
3.Nitro charging with speed(going above 50km/h slowly charges the nitro while slow down bellow 50km/h discharges the nitro)and with drift(drift counter by Blumlaut)

Controls:
Left Shift when you speeding up (W pressed) for nitro usage.
Left Shift when you are stopped or bellow 50km/h for purge show.(not W pressed)

The script is standalone and the exhaust effect is synced with other players.(as the original script)

Nitro is empty when you enter a car(not on motorbikes,bikes,boats,planes,utility or service vehicles) and not charging when going bellow 50km/h.
Also it gets empty instantly when you get out of the vehicle.

When you are the driver and the vehicle speeds up above 50km/h the nitro charges.
If you get out of the vehicle nitro becomes empty and if you slow down bellow 50km/h nitro discharge 99% to 70% of nitro (rapid discharge) , 70% to 50% slower drain
and 50% to empty , really slow drain of nitro.

It  goes up to 100% where the nitro locks in ready state(nitro is not drained even if you stop but it will empty if you leave the vehicle)

Nitro is charging by drifting (points are held for 4 seconds in case of drifting again as a multi-bonus)
